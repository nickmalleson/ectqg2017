# ECTQG 2017 website README

Website based on template: _Horizons_ by TEMPLATED

## Website structure

                    default.html   - the  _includes page that everything inherits
                      |     |
                      |     |
         post.html  <--      --> main - the other _includes pages that are actually used in content

Note: to change the site header, you need to edit main.html, except for the index.html page which
defines its own header.

## Pages

index.html -> only page that used _default_ directly. It has its own slightly different style

## Other info
