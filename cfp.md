## Call for Organised Sessions

We are pleased to announce a call for organised sessions for the ECTQG 2017. Topics for sessions can cover any aspect of quantitative and theoretical geography, but we are particularly interested in those that reflect the [conference themes]({{site.baseurl}}/themes.html).

To organise a session, you will need to submit a session title, abstract, and the names of the authors and titles of the papers that will be presented the session. You can organise multiple sessions if you would like to. If there are too few presenters for a session, the organising committee can assign additional papers to the session as appropriate.

If you would like to organise a session, please email Michelle Morris ([M.Morris@leeds.ac.uk](M.Morris@leeds.ac.uk)) or Nick Malleson ([n.s.malleson@leeds.ac.uk](n.s.malleson@leeds.ac.uk)) with the session title, abstract, and paper titles.


## Call for Abstracts

_The call for abstracts will be announced on 6th March. Please see the [key dates]({{site.baseurl}}/dates.html) for more information..._
