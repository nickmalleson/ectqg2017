We are pleased to announce four keynote presenters who will talk at the ECTQG 2017

### [Sir Alan Wilson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=AGWIL25)

Sir Alan Wilson FBA, FAcSS, FRS is Chief Executive of the Alan Turing Institute and Professor of Urban and Regional Systems in the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. He is Chair of the Home Office Science Advisory Council. 
He was responsible for the introduction of a number of model building techniques which are now in common use internationally – such as the use of 'entropy' in building spatial interaction models – summarised in _Entropy in urban and regional modelling_. His current research is on the evolution of cities and global dynamics.  He writes the [Quaestio](http://quaestio.blogweb.casa.ucl.ac.uk/) blog on research and interdisciplinarity.
He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds from 1991 to 2004 when he became Director-General for Higher Education in the then DfES. From 2007-2013 he was Chair of the Arts and Humanities Research Council and from 2013-2015, of the Lead Expert Group for the Government Office for Science Foresight Project on The Future of Cities. 
He is a Member of Academia Europaea, an FBA, an FAcSS and an FRS. He was knighted in 2001. His recent books include _Knowledge power_ (2010), _The science of cities and regions_ (2012), his five volume (edited) _Urban modelling_ (2012), (with Joel Dearden) _Explorations in urban and regional dynamics_ (2015) and two edited volumes, _Global dynamics_ and _Geo-mathematical modelling_ (2016).

### [Alison Heppenstall](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.heppenstall)

Alison Heppenstall is a Professor of Geocomputation at the School of Geography, University of Leeds. Her research interests are focused on the development of AI methods, particularly agent-based modelling, for understanding processes and evolution of geographical systems. In particular she is interested in methods for incorporating human behaviour in individual-level models and big data analytics. Professor Heppenstall's recent contributions include the editted collection _Agent-Based Models of Geographical Systems_ (with  A. Crooks, L. See, and M. Batty, 2012).

### [Paul Longley](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/paul-longley)

Paul Longley B.Sc., Ph.D., D.Sc., FAcSS. holds a chair in Geographic Information Science at University College London (UCL), UK. His research interests are in Geographic Information Science and Systems, and he is a co-author of a best-selling book on this subject. He has worked as PI of Co-I on more than 50 research grants totalling over £20 million and has supervised more than 50 Ph.D. students (most funded by research councils). His publications include nineteen books, and over 150 refereed journal articles and contributions to edited collections. He currently directs the Consumer Data Research Centre at UCL. His academic and editorial Duties include past editorship of Computers, Environment and Urban Systems and Environment and Planning B. He has also held eleven externally funded visiting appointments and given more than 150 conference presentations and external seminars.

### [Anne Vernez-Moudon](https://depts.washington.edu/ufl/people/anne/index.html)

Anne Vernez Moudon is Professor Emerita of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Urban Design and Planning; Adjunct Professor of Epidemiology and Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, where she also directs the Urban Form Lab (UFL). Prof. Vernez Moudon’s published works include _Built for Change: Neighborhood Architecture in San Francisco_ (MIT Press 1986), _Public Streets for Public Use_ (Columbia University Press 1991), and _Monitoring Land Supply with Geographic Information Systems_ (with M. Hubner, John Wiley & Sons, 2000). Her recent publications on built environment and behaviour are in transport and health journals.

### [Chris Brunsdon](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/chris-brunsdon)

Chris Brunsdon is a Professor of Geocomputation and Director of the National Centre for Geocomputation at Maynooth University, Ireland. Prior to this he was a Professor of Human Geography at the University of Liverpool in the UK, and before this he worked in the Universities of Leicester, Glamorgan and Newcastle. He has degrees from Durham University (BSc Mathematics) and Newcastle University (MSc Medical Statistics, PhD in Geography). 

His most recent books include  _Geocomputation: A Practical Primer_ (with Alex Singleton, 2015)  and _An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping_ (with Alexis Comber, 2015).
