We are pleased to announce four keynote presenters who will talk at the ECTQG 2017:

### [Sir Alan Wilson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=AGWIL25)

Sir Alan Wilson FBA, FAcSS, FRS is Professor of Urban and Regional Systems in the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. He is Chair of the Home Office Science Advisory Council and of the Lead Expert Group for the Government Office for Science Foresight Project on The Future of Cities. He writes the weekly Quaestio blog on research and interdisciplinarity. He was knighted in 2001. His recent books include _Knowledge power_ (2010), _The science of cities and regions (2012)_, his five volume (edited) _Urban modelling_ (2012) and (with Joel Dearden) _Explorations in urban and regional dynamics_ (2015). 

### [Alison Heppenstall](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.heppenstall)

Alison Heppenstall is a Professor of Geocomputation at the School of Geography, University of Leeds. Her research interests are focused on the development of AI methods, particularly agent-based modelling, for understanding processes and evolution of geographical systems. In particular she is interested in methods for incorporating human behaviour in individual-level models and big data analytics. Professor Heppenstall's recent contributions include the editted collection _Agent-Based Models of Geographical Systems_ (with  A. Crooks, L. See, and M. Batty, 2012).

### [Anne Vernez-Moudon](https://depts.washington.edu/ufl/people/anne/index.html)

Anne Vernez Moudon is Professor of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Urban Design and Planning; Adjunct Professor of Epidemiology and Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, where she also directs the Urban Form Lab (UFL). 

Prof. Moudonâ€™s published works include _Built for Change: Neighborhood Architecture in San Francisco_ (MIT Press 1986), _Public Streets for Public Use_ (Columbia University Press 1991), and _Monitoring Land Supply with Geographic Information Systems_ (with M. Hubner, John Wiley & Sons, 2000). She has also published several monographs, such as _Master-Planned Communities: Shaping Exurbs in the 1990_ (with B. Wiseman and K.J. Kim, distributed by the APA Bookstore, 1992) and _Urban Design: Reshaping Our Cities_ (with W. Attoe, University of Washington, College of Architecture and Urban Planning, 1995).

### [Chris Brunsdon](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/chris-brunsdon)

Chris Brunsdon is a Professor of Geocomputation and Director of the National Centre for Geocomputation at Maynooth University, Ireland. Prior to this he was a Professor of Human Geography at the University of Liverpool in the UK, and before this he worked in the Universities of Leicester, Glamorgan and Newcastle. He has degrees from Durham University (BSc Mathematics) and Newcastle University (MSc Medical Statistics, PhD in Geography). 

His most recent books include  _Geocomputation: A Practical Primer_ (with Alex Singleton, 2015)  and _An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping_ (with Alexis Comber, 2015).
